========================

Objective-C implementation of the Off-The-Record protocol.

# Goals

 * Exclusively use CommonCrypto and Security framework. OpenSSL sucks.
 * Implement full OTR protocol (v1, v2, v3)
 * Implement additional OTR channel
 * Write unit tests. None exist at all for OTR!

Protocol is credited to https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/, all code is mine.
